I started my coding journey 3 years ago, driven by my curiosity about how the web works. Fast forward to today, and I have been opportune to work on many freelance projects. I’m passionate about coding beautiful designs, coupled with user-friendly functionality and this is reflected in every project I worked on.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics.I’ve had the privilege of being part of numerous teams, where I’ve not only contributed as a member but also led many as well. This has helped me grown a very collaborative skills.

If you’ve got a project idea or proposal, I’m your go-to person. Let’s create something amazing together!</p>
